Dear all,

The project is compiled with Visual Studio 2008 community edition.


Any kind of participation is welcome.
From my side I see three regions where the project needs improvement:

1) It needs a generic animation control, not specific to files
2) An animation control that displays progress of single files, if they take longer
3) Unit tests with fully simulated files and fully simulated directories

Best regards
